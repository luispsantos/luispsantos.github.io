Hey there, my name is *Luís Santos*.
I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Instituto Superior Técnico(IST). I hold a BsC in Computer Science from the same university.
During the academic year of 2016/2017 I was an Erasmus student at KTH, Sweden, mostly taking courses from the MsC in Machine Learning programme that KTH offers.
My current interests are in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.
My main hope with this personal blog is to be able to write about some current projects I have been involved in.
