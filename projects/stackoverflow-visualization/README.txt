It's highly recommended to use Firefox in order to provide the best experience.
Not only can it load CSVs from the disk without an http server, but its latest version (aka Firefox Quantum) provides the best rendering performance.

Another browser with a great experience is Microsoft Edge.
Google Chrome and Safari have some visual glitches due to incomplete SVG support.
